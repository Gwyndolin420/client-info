what you need to do
1) Send 2 copies of physical bills and 1 internet bill PDF - a photo of each physical bill with all four corners showing with everything legible. Each bill should match your current address and be current from within the last two months. This can be done by having a copy of your rental statement, internet bill, bank statements, retirement account info, utility bills, etc. These should be documents sent in the mail. We can include one internet bill PDF as a backup or to get things rolling off the bat if absolutely needed. But an internet bill will need to be quickly supplanted with physical bills. If we need to wait on physical bills to come contact your bank or landlord and get the next bill sent in the mail. We can go with the internet bill for the first couple weeks.It’s best to provide everything up front and out of the way and this will be a truly passive income game!

2) 2 government issued ID with a photo on it - front and back of a driver’s license, passport page, state id, military id, etc.. If only have one a second form could be another photo id like a student id, a library card, etc. But government issued ids are definitely best. Again have all four corners showing in the photo and make sure the text is legible. Provide as many available government issued photo ids as possible.

3) Selfie with ids - hold each id and take a selfie with your face in the id. Don’t block any of the text with your fingers. Make sure the text of the id is legible left to right. Sometimes in selfie mode it will invert the text.  Be sure to get a selfie with each ID they are using. Just the photo side of each Id they are using is sufficient. 

4) Send me the photos first on messenger so I can approve and request any changes. He's picky about the photo quality and following the requirements so read closely and this will go quickly. This way we can have quick and easy back and forth communication. When we have the final versions approved then I can upload into the shared Google Drive folder with your name that I have linked to you in the email. 

5) When our guy has registered and approved you completely we will send out the computer directly to your address. You won’t need to pay for this. Please let me know if there are any special instructions to receive a package. When you receive the computer message me. Make sure you have the ability to connect it to an outlet and WiFi. Once the PC is connected to electricity, and is online with the home WiFi, you'll need to install the remote control app on it. I'll send you a link, and it's usually a 10 minute job. If nothing gets fucked up....
For the computer setup connect it to a monitor with mouse and keyboard ideally. I’ll give you a specific link to share the remote access with our guy. Click the link with the 24 hour expiration date. Mark yes. Download and install.

It asks you in which way the authentication will be. One option is to use windows login credentials. The other option is creating a password for the logmein. Choose the option to create a password. Make the password Morning7 and we should be good. After that go into the power settings on the menu and select all the options so that it never shuts down (sometimes the computer wants to shut down after an hour of inactivity so just change the setting). Do this by clicking start - settings - search "power" - power and sleep settings:

Screen:
when plugged in, then off after -- choose never

Sleep:
When plugged in, PC goes to sleep after -- choose never

When you’re doing this we can try to be in touch live to make sure its still connected to the wifi after you disconnect it from the monitor and store it away. It isn’t necessary to be live but it’s best if we are each available so try to contact me. Once approved place the computer in a spot where it can stay connected to WiFi and power and you shouldn’t ever need to mess with it. The goal of this business is to be hands off - out of sight, out of mind. The computer makes a barely noticeable noise and has some subtle lights so consider that too in the placement. 

6) When the computer setup has all been verified you’re ready to receive your first payout of $250 sent in bitcoin at the day’s current price. Send me a BTC address I can send the money to. Send me your account info on the app you would like to use the most other than your direct phone number (I’m out of the country and don’t want to bother my business partners with texting about this on our business number).. It will be good for me to know the best ways to get ahold of you as we go. (Messenger, WhatsApp, Discord, etc) all work for me. Let me know what’s best for you.

Some Extra Points to Keep in mind:

1) Be patient in the beginning. It can sometimes take a couple months for winnings to start paying out. He has his sophisticated withdrawal system down to a tee that maximizes what we can make from the accounts over time that also doesn’t alert their systems we are earning too much too quickly. He also works with several clients so sometimes their withdrawals take priority. He can’t withdraw on all accounts at the same time, for example, because he doesn’t want to risk them withholding payment. Basically he has his system down to a tee so don’t put pressure on him. The money will come and it will typically snowball. But be patient for it to be a bit slow in the beginning. And be available over the course of the time your accounts are open to update a bill and notify us if you have a change in living situation. 

2) Be on the lookout and spot opportunities for new clients we could signup. Know they’re situation, their needs, their values and frame it as an opportunity that benefits their life situation. Don’t over-promise payouts or get too caught up in the technical components of how this works. It’s an opportunity to make passive income in a relatively safe and secure way working with someone you trust. If they are interested then we can chat together about when we could bring them on board and the best way to close the deal with them.
