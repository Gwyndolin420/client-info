1. The Pitch:

Be on the lookout and spot opportunities for new clients we could signup. 
Know they’re situation, their needs, their values and frame it as an opportunity that benefits their life situation. 
It’s an opportunity to make passive income in a relatively safe and secure way working with someone you trust.
If they are interested then we can chat together about when we could bring them on board and the best way to close the deal with them.

Float the opportunity as a way to make extra money from a promotion that I’ve done successfully but has run out.
If you want, I could get you setup and manage your account and we could share in the profits of the promotion together. 
No bank accounts, no credit cards, no social security, everything paid in crypto. Everything is done outside the US and encrypted. 
Not much work other than setting things up for a couple hours and being free for little bits of communication here and there. 
Basically no risk with a high upside for reward. Especially if you can refer new clients. 
You make an extra $1000-$3000 over the next several months once you turn it on.
I pay a bonus for just getting started once the registration has been accepted. Just something to think about.
If you like it and know some people that can join you can make more passive, zero risk money ongoing. 

The idea for you is to not get them too focused on how it works, what exactly it will pay out, etc. 
Stay focused on the benefits of the opportunity especially as they pertain to that person’s life situation. 
You know them best. You can send questions up to me and I can send them to him,
but in general assure them you’ll get answered and remember that they’re just wanting their fears covered. 
Stress that it’s safe and you’ve had a good experience making money and it’s very little work for them. 
Things are kept private and they’ll be working working with people you know and trust.
